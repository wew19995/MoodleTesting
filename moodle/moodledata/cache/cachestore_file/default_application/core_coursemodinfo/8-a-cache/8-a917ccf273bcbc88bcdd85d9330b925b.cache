sophisticated accounting system. A general accounting system is a system
 that keeps track of inventory on a periodic basis. This was most often 
used in manufacturing companies.</p><p><p>Basically, a general accounting system would count the inventory or 
track it periodically rather than continually. In other words, the 
inventory would be counted in one stage then a few weeks or months would
 go by and the inventory would be counted at another stage. Think about 
how horrible this data is for management.</p>
<p>It is completely outdated and inaccurate. How is management supposed 
to make decisions and strategies based on inventory numbers that are 
always out of date and inaccurate? That is why more companies are moving
 away from traditional general accounting systems.</p><br></p>";s:12:"availability";s:28:"{"op":"&","c":[],"showc":[]}";}i:1;O:8:"stdClass":4:{s:2:"id";s:2:"20";s:4:"name";s:33:"Introduction to Accounting Basics";s:7:"summary";s:1165:"<p><p>This explanation of accounting basics will introduce you to some
