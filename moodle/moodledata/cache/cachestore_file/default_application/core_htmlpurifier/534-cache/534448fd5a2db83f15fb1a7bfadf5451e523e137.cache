s:698:"<p>Rather than keeping everything in one big list, questions may be arranged into categories and subcategories.</p>

<p>Each category has a context which determines where the questions in the category can be used:</p>

<ul><li>Activity context - Questions only available in the activity module</li>
<li>Course context - Questions available in all activity modules in the course</li>
<li>Course category context - Questions available in all activity modules and courses in the course category</li>
<li>System context - Questions available in all courses and activities on the site</li>
</ul><p>Categories are also used for random questions, as questions are selected from a particular category.</p>
